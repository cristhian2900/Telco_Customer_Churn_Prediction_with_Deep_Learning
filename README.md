# üìä Telco Customer Churn Prediction with Deep Learning

This project aims to predict **customer churn** for a telecommunications company using a deep learning approach. Built using Python and Keras, the model explores how regularization, model tuning, and proper preprocessing can significantly impact predictive performance.

## üöÄ Overview

Customer churn is a crucial business metric. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, companies can take proactive steps to retain them. In this notebook, we develop and evaluate a deep learning model trained on Telco customer data to detect churners before they leave.

The project covers:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature transformation and scaling
- Neural network modeling with:
  - L1, L2, and L1+L2 regularization
- Performance evaluation via metrics and ROC curves
- Hyperparameter optimization using **Keras Tuner**

## üß† Deep Learning Model

### Why 16 Neurons in the First Layer?

- **Input Shape**: 18 features after preprocessing
- **Chosen Hidden Units**: 16 neurons (close to number of input features)
- **Reason**: Based on empirical practice for simplicity and efficiency
- **Tuning Ready**: The architecture allows for easy scaling with tools like `KerasTuner`

### Regularization Techniques Used:
- **L1**: Encourages sparsity
- **L2**: Penalizes large weights to reduce overfitting
- **Combined**: A hybrid regularization technique balancing sparsity and generalization
